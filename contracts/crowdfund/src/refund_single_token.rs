/// @title   RefundSingle — Single-contributor token refund logic
/// @notice  Encapsulates the token transfer step that returns a contributor's
///          funds during a failed or cancelled crowdfund campaign.
/// @dev     This module documents and validates the `refund_single` pattern
///          used inside the bulk `refund()` and `cancel()` flows of the
///          CrowdfundContract.  It is intentionally kept as a pure, testable
///          unit so that the transfer logic can be reasoned about in isolation.
///
/// ## Security Assumptions
/// 1. The caller (the contract itself) already holds the tokens to be
///    returned — no external pull is performed here.
/// 2. The contribution amount stored in persistent storage is the single
///    source of truth; it is zeroed **after** a successful transfer to
///    prevent double-refund.
/// 3. Zero-amount contributions are skipped to avoid wasting gas on no-op
///    transfers.
/// 4. Overflow is impossible because `amount` is an `i128` read directly
///    from storage and was validated at contribution time.
/// 5. The token client is constructed from the address stored at
///    initialisation — it cannot be substituted by a caller.
///
/// ## Token Transfer Flow (refund_single)
